:strawberry: A landing page where you can list all the apps and services stored in different places and access them from a single page.

## Introduction
So the main idea for this landing page was to have all my usual links plus the services stored on different servers/vms, like Deluge, CouchPotato, Sonarr and many more.

I came up with this when I was looking for a landing page, there were good ones but I wanted to make something fresh and either material design o metro design, ended up picking metro because, well, it looks cool.

Also I used [simpleWeather](http://simpleweatherjs.com/) and added some weather information on the header.

## What's next?
My plans for the upcomings days is to build a backend in NodeJS that will allow the user to add links/services from the landing page itself.

I am open to suggestions and critics.

## Where are the links stored?
Everything regarding the links are stored in a .json file, there for now, you can add the links with its title and colour.

This is ithe scheme of the json file:

```json
{  
   "name": "Sonarr",
   "link": "https://sonarr.tv/",
   "colour": "cyan"
}
```
Name -> is the title that is shown in the page.<br>
Link -> URL to the link/service/app.<br>
Colour -> Background colour of service, to see the available colours go to [css/colors.css](https://github.com/emimontesdeoca/jordgubbe/blob/master/css/colors.css).

## What about the weather?

Everything is pretty easy to modify, in the [js/app.js](https://github.com/emimontesdeoca/jordgubbe/blob/master/js/app.js) file you can see how the simplyWeather is, if you just want to change the location, change the loadWeather function call:

```javascript
{  
   $(document).ready(function() {
        loadWeather('your_location', '');
    });
}
```

## Questions and issues

You can use the github issue tracker for bug reports, feature requests, questions.

## Thanks

Thanks to simplyWeather for its API, r/homelab for being a cool subreddit, and myself for finishing the project(for now!).
